        <!-- My OCD drove me nuts for paragraph formating. I used many <br>, I believe you hate them, I do too now, I look forward to learning CSS and never doing <br> every again lol. The song will make up for it, check out the song and the band. -->
          <p>(Paper cuts, paper cuts)<br>
          (Paper cuts, paper cuts)</p>

          <p>Bare knuckles, we don't wear gloves<br>
          'Cause we need to feel connection<br>
          To the animal inside of us<br>
          That claims no recollection<br>
          And we always have to aim so low<br>
          'Cause we need to feel connection</p>

          <p>So why should I run from paper tigers?<br>
          Why should I run from paper tigers?<br>
          Just 'cause you scratch colored orange and black<br>
          Just 'cause you scratch colored orange and black<br>
          Just 'cause you scratch colored orange and black<br>
          I know they're only paper cuts, only paper cuts</p>

          <p>So I don't need another anthem<br>
          To understand where I'm comin' from<br>
          Or to buy my way in Heaven<br>
          'Cause of everything that they don't know<br>
          And claims no recollection</p>

          <p> So why should I run from paper tigers?<br>
          Why should I run from paper tigers?<br>
          Just 'cause you scratch colored orange and black<br>
          Just 'cause you scratch colored orange and black<br>
          Just 'cause you scratch colored orange and black<br>
          I know they're only paper cuts, only paper cuts</p>

          <p>  Don't need, don't need another anthem<br>
          To understand where I'm comin' from<br>
          Or to buy my way in Heaven<br>
          To the... to the animal inside of us<br>
          That claim no recollection<br>
          The witness has refection<br>
          Oh, the witness has reflection<br>
          Oh, the witness has reflection</p>

          <p>So why should I run from paper tigers?<br>
           Why should I run from paper tigers?<br>
           Just 'cause you scratch colored orange and black<br>
           Just 'cause you scratch colored orange and black<br>
           Just 'cause you scratch colored orange and black<br>
           I know they're only paper cuts, only paper cuts</p>

           <p>Oh, the witness has reflection<br>
           Oh, the witness has reflection<br>
           (Paper cuts, paper cuts)<br>
